# About Me
I am a computer science and engineering graduate with a passion for computer vision research. I have excellent analytical and technological
skills, as well as a strong foundation in various domains of computer science, such as algorithms, data structures, databases, operating systems,
networks, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. I have also completed several projects and internships that involved applying my
theoretical knowledge to real-world problems using computer vision techniques and tools, such as image processing, object detection, face
recognition, and semantic segmentation. I aspire to become a computer vision researcher who can develop novel and effective solutions for
enterprises and society by addressing challenging challenges with computer vision methods and insights

# Publications
### Convolutional Neural Network Modeling for eye Disease Recognition - 2022
In this paper, I presented a novel approach for diagnosing common eye diseases, such as Cataract, Chalazion, Squint, and Normal eye, from the
user’s photos. The approach used image processing techniques to preprocess and segment the images and deep learning techniques to classify
the images into different categories of eye diseases. The paper was published in the International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering
(iJOE), which is a Q2 journal according to Scimago Journal Rank
